The need of building Machine Learning (ML) models based on ever increasing amounts of data brought new challenges to data management systems. Feature Stores have emerged as an effective solution to enable feature reuse, while organizing data transformations and ensuring consistency between feature engineering, model training and model inference. Recent publications demonstrate that the Hopsworks Feature Store exhibits superior performance metrics in both training and online inference query workloads compared to existing cloud-based alternatives. In this system, the latency to perform a write operation in this system a least of one or more minutes even for small quantities of data (1 GB or less). 
This limitation is believed to a Spark-specific limitation, which the system uses to write data on the offline feature store. This hypothesis was already confirmed in the case of read latency, where opting for a Spark-alternative, namely an Arrow Flight and DuckDB server, improved performance considerably. A promising approach appears to be adopting a new data management solution, namely Delta Lake, and accessing it using a Rust library called delta-rs. 
This thesis investigates the possibility of reducing the read and write latency in the offline feature store by expanding the delta-rs library to support the Hopsworks Feature Store file system called HopsFS, and comparatively evaluating the performance of the legacy and newly implemented system.
After a first iterative system implementation phase based on fixed requirements, the system was evaluated by performing and measuring read and write operations in a four different CPU configurations (increasing the number of CPU cores up to eight). Experiments were performed fifty times to estimate a confidence interval allowing a comparative evaluation of the systems.
Results confirmed the superior performance of the delta-rs library over the Spark system in all write operations with a tenfold reduction in the latency. Delta-rs also surpassed the Spark-alternative in read operations with a tenfold reduction in the latency in all but the experiment with the largest table (60M rows), where the improvement is of a smaller factor.
These findings encourage future research investigating Spark-alternative when optimizing performance in small scale (1 GB - 100 GB) data management systems.

\begin{comment}
\engExpl{The following are some notes about what can be included (in terms of LaTeX) in your abstract.}
Choice of typeface with \textbackslash textit, \textbackslash textbf, and \textbackslash texttt:  \textit{x}, \textbf{x}, and \texttt{x}.

Text superscripts and subscripts with \textbackslash textsubscript and \textbackslash textsuperscript: A\textsubscript{x} and A\textsuperscript{x}.

Some symbols that you might find useful are available, such as: \textbackslash textregistered, \textbackslash texttrademark, and \textbackslash textcopyright. For example, 
the copyright symbol: \textbackslash textcopyright Maguire 2022 results in \textcopyright Maguire 2022. Additionally, here are some examples of text superscripts (which can be combined with some symbols): \textbackslash textsuperscript\{99m\}Tc, A\textbackslash textsuperscript\{*\}, A\textbackslash textsuperscript\{\textbackslash textregistered\}, and A\textbackslash texttrademark resulting in \textsuperscript{99m}Tc, A\textsuperscript{*}, A\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, and A\texttrademark. Two examples of subscripts are: H\textbackslash textsubscript\{2\}O and CO\textbackslash textsubscript\{2\} which produce  H\textsubscript{2}O and CO\textsubscript{2}.

You can use simple environments with begin and end: itemize and enumerate and within these use instances of \textbackslash item.

The following commands can be used: \textbackslash eg, \textbackslash Eg, \textbackslash ie, \textbackslash Ie, \textbackslash etc, and \textbackslash etal: \eg, \Eg, \ie, \Ie, \etc, and \etal.

The following commands for numbering with lowercase Roman numerals: \textbackslash first, \textbackslash Second, \textbackslash third, \textbackslash fourth, \textbackslash fifth, \textbackslash sixth, \textbackslash seventh, and \textbackslash eighth: \first, \Second, \third, \fourth, \fifth, \sixth, \seventh, and \eighth. Note that the second case is set with a capital 'S' to avoid conflicts with the use of second of as a unit in the \texttt{siunitx} package.

Equations using \textbackslash( xxxx \textbackslash) or \textbackslash[ xxxx \textbackslash] can be used in the abstract. For example: \( (C_5O_2H_8)_n \)
or \[ \int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx \]
Note that you \textbf{cannot} use an equation between dollar signs.

Even LaTeX comments can be handled, for example: \% comment.
Note that one can include percentages, such as: 51\% or \SI{51}{\percent}.

\subsection*{Keywords}
\begin{scontents}[store-env=keywords,print-env=true]
% If you set the EnglishKeywords earlier, you can retrieve them with:
\InsertKeywords{english}
% If you did not set the EnglishKeywords earlier then simply enter the keywords here:
%First keyword, Second keyword, Third keyword, Fourth keyword
\end{scontents}
%%\engExpl{\textbf{Choosing good keywords can help others to locate your paper, thesis, dissertation, \ldots and related work.}}
%%Choose the most specific keyword from those used in your domain, see for example: the ACM Computing Classification System ({\small \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/computing-classification-system/how-to-use})},
%%the IEEE Taxonomy ({\small \url{https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus-thank-you.html}}), PhySH (Physics Subject Headings)\linebreak[4] ({\small \url{https://physh.aps.org/}}), \ldots or keyword selection tools such as the  National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)  ({\small \url{https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/authors.html}}) or Google's Keyword Tool ({\small \url{https://keywordtool.io/}})\\

%%\textbf{Formatting the keywords}:
%%\begin{itemize}
%%  \item The first letter of a keyword should be set with a capital letter and proper names should be capitalized as usual.
%%  \item Spell out acronyms and abbreviations.
%%  \item Avoid "stop words" - as they generally carry little or no information.
%%  \item List your keywords separated by commas (",").
%%\end{itemize}    
%%Since you should have both English and Swedish keywords - you might think of ordering them in corresponding order (\ie, so that the n\textsuperscript{th} word in each list correspond) - this makes it easier to mechanically find matching keywords.
