%Summary of the method section here
This chapter following the two \glspl{RQ} defined in Section \ref{sec:researchQuestion} defines two methodologies that will be applied sequentially in this project. Section \ref{sec:sys_impl} defines the system implementation process which outputs the D1, i.e. a the code implementation, that will enable the system evaluation defined in Section \ref{sec:sys_eval} which will output D2, i.e. the experiments results which analysis will be delivered in D3.
