%Summary of the method section here
This chapter following the two \glspl{RQ} defined in Section~\ref{subsec:researchQuestion} defines two methodologies that will be applied sequentially in this project. Section~\ref{sec:sys_impl} defines the system implementation process which outputs the D1, i.e. the code implementation, that will enable the system evaluation defined in Section~\ref{sec:sys_eval} which will output D2, i.e. the results of the experiment which analysis will be delivered in D3.
