Once \gls{HDFS} and \gls{HopsFS} support has been added to the delta-rs library, it is sufficient to build a python wheel, i.e., a pre-built binary package format for Python modules and libraries, for delta-rs. The Python wheel for the library can be built by following the instructions already present in the delta-rs library in the README.md file present in the python folder~\footnote{Instructions available at \url{https://github.com/Silemo/delta-rs/blob/main/python/README.md}}.

The usage of the delta-rs library is explained in detail in the delta-rs documentation~\footnote{Documentation available at \url{https://delta-io.github.io/delta-rs/}}, so in this section, only the method used for the experiments will be shown and explained. Listing \ref{lst:write_delta-rs} shows a simple example of writing to \gls{HDFS} or \gls{HopsFS} (formally in a Python script, only the address changes, as \gls{HopsFS} is based on \gls{HDFS}). As the listing shows, the script writes a small table of two columns and three rows.

\begin{python}[caption={[Writing with delta-rs]Writing a DataFrame on a Delta Table with delta-rs on \gls{HDFS} or \gls{HopsFS}.}, label={lst:write_delta-rs}]
from deltalake import write_deltalake
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({"num": [1, 2, 3], 
                   "letter": ["a", "b", "c"]})
write_deltalake("hdfs://rpc.sys:8020/tmp/test", df)
\end{python}
\end{minipage}

An example of a read operation is shown in Listing \ref{lst:read_delta-rs}. After being read, the Delta Table is converted to a pyarrow table to ensure an explicit in-memory operation (only calling the DeltaTable object is a lazy operation that does not load the data into memory).

from deltalake import DeltaTable

dt = DeltaTable("hdfs://rpc.sys:8020/tmp/test")
dt.to_pyarrow_table()
