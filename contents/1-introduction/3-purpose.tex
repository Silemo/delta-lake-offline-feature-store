%%% MOTIVATION
This thesis project aims to reduce the read and write latency (seconds) and thus increase the data throughput (rows/second) for operations on the Hopsworks offline feature store. This study will compare the performance of the current legacy pipeline, Spark-based for writing, with the delta-rs pipeline on a small-scale data by evaluating differences in terms of latency and throughput in read and write operations. As a prospect for future work, if delta-rs is proven to be a more performant alternative, Hopsworks \gls{AB} will consider integrating this pipeline into their application.

Overall implications for this thesis work are much broader considering Spark's popularity in the open-source community (more than 2800 contributors during its lifetime \cite{ApacheSparkOpen}). Choosing delta-rs over Spark gives developers a broader range of alternatives when working on a small-scale data (1 GB - 100 GB).
