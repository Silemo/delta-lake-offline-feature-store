%%% MOTIVATION
This thesis project aims to contribute to reducing the read and write latency (seconds) and thus increasing the data throughput (rows/second) for operations on the Hopsworks offline feature store. This study will compare the performance of the current legacy pipeline, which is Spark-based for writing, with the delta-rs pipeline on a small scale by evaluating differences in read latency (seconds), write latency (seconds), and computed throughput (rows/second). As a prospect for future work, if delta-rs is proven to be a more performant alternative (in terms of latency and data throughput), Hopsworks \gls{AB} will consider integrating this pipeline into their application.

Overall implications for this thesis work are much broader considering Spark's popularity in the open source community (more than 2800 contributors during its lifetime \cite{ApacheSparkOpen}). Choosing delta-rs over Spark gives developers a broader range of alternatives when working on a "small scale" (1 GB to 100 GB).
