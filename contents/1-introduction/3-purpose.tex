%%% MOTIVATION
The purpose of this thesis project is to contribute to reducing the read and write latency (seconds), and thus increasing the data throughput (rows/second), for operations on the Hopsworks Offline Feature Store. This work will identify which one between a current legacy pipeline (Spark-based in writing) and a delta-rs pipeline performs better at a small scale, by comparing the differences in read latency (seconds), write latency (seconds), and computed throughput (rows/second). As a prospect for future work, if delta-rs is proven to be a more performant alternative (in terms of latency and data throughput), Hopsworks \gls{AB} will consider integrating this pipeline into their application.

Overall implications for this thesis work are much wider considering the popularity Spark has in the open source community (more than 2800 contributors during its lifetime \cite{ApacheSparkOpen}). This would enable developers to have a wider range of alternatives when working on "small scale" (1 GB to 100 GB) systems by choosing delta-rs over Spark.
