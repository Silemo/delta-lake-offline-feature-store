%%% MOTIVATION
The purpose of this thesis project is to contribute to reducing the read and write time, and thus increasing the data throughput, for operations on the Delta Lake-based  Hopsworks Offline Feature Store. This work will identify which one between a Spark pipeline and a delta-rs pipeline on Delta Lake performs better, by comparing the differences in read time, write time, and computed throughput. As a prospect for future work, if delta-rs is proven to be a more performant alternative (in terms of data throughput), Hopsworks will consider integrating this pipeline into their application.

Overall implications for this thesis work are much wider counting the popularity Spark has in the open source community (more than 2800 contributors during its lifetime \cite{ApacheSparkOpen}). This would enable developers to have a wider range of alternatives when working on "small scale" (1 GB to 100 GB) systems by choosing delta-rs over Spark.
