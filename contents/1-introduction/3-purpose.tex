The purpose of the project is to reduce the read and write time for operations on the Hopsworks Feature Store built on top of Delta Lake tables. The main use case in consideration is a small scale amount of data (10 GB - 100 GB), as Hopsworks users mostly work with this amounts of data, when using the platform. Thanks to this improvement, developers working with the Feature Store will see an improvement in productivity and reduce friction with the development tool.

While managers of other professions typically focus on employee productivity, in software engineering it a good approach is to focus on limiting friction between developers and tools, so that they can focus on value creation. For such effective environment to grow a micro-feedback loops structure is created, enabling developers to work with continuous feedback \cite{cochranMaximizingDeveloperEffectiveness2021}. Faster read and write operations on the Feature Store would enable the creations of such feedback loops.

On top of reducing work time for a developer, an efficient working environment can be a positive attractor \cite{graziotinTheoryAffectSoftware2016} incrementing the happiness and thus performance of the developer.
