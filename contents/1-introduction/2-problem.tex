Hopsworks Feature Store \cite{HopsworksBatchRealtime2024}, currently has a large time overhead when starting Spark (around 5 minutes) even for the most simple operation. 
This overhead is less relevant for computation on larger quantities of data (1 TB or above), as it composes a smaller part of the overall computation time (\todo[inline]{INSERT COMPUTATION PERCENTAGE TIME HERE}). % TODO insert computation percentage time.
Nonetheless Hopsworks' typical use-case sits between tests on small quantities of data (scale between 1-10 GBs) and production scenarios on larger scale, but still relatively small (scale between 10-100 GBs). % TODO Verify this statement with Jim D.
As this overhead is caused by starting up Spark jobs, we need to look for Spark alternatives. Currently Hopsworks is saving their Feature Store data on Apache Hudi and Delta Lake table formats. Delta Lake supports Spark alternatives for accessing and querying the data, of particular interest is the library delta-rs \cite{DeltaioDeltars2024} that enables Python access to Delta Lake tables, without having the time overhead given by Spark jobs. 
However, the delta-rs \cite{DeltaioDeltars2024} does not support \gls{HDFS}, thus not even HopsFS, Hopsworks' \gls{HDFS} distribution \cite{niaziHopsFSScalingHierarchical2017}.

% Research Question
\subsection{Research Question}
\label{sec:researchQuestion}
This research project has the ultimate objective to evaluate and compare Apache Spark access to Delta Lake to a delta-rs library \cite{DeltaioDeltars2024} based access, for Hopsworks' \gls{HDFS} distribution HopsFS \cite{niaziHopsFSScalingHierarchical2017}. To achieve this, support for \gls{HDFS} must be added to the delta-rs library \cite{DeltaioDeltars2024}, so that it can be compatible with Hopsworks system. Thus the project can be divided among the following two \glspl{RQ}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[RQ1:] How can we add support for \gls{HDFS} to the delta-rs library?
    \item[RQ2:] What is the difference in performance between an Apache Spark based access to Delta Lake compared a the delta-rs library based access, in HopsFS, Hopsworks' \gls{HDFS} distribution?  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scientific and engineering issues}
% Outline of the various problems to address during implementation
Delta-rs \cite{DeltaioDeltars2024} as the name suggests is a Rust \cite{RustProgrammingLanguage} library, that offers Python bindings. Rust is a compiled language, and as such it does not need an interpreter as Python or virtual environment as Java. This means that it is particularly easy to embed and use Rust code as library in another language such as Python. 

Currently delta-rs does not support \gls{HDFS} (or the Hopsworks distribution, HopsFS \cite{niaziHopsFSScalingHierarchical2017}). This means that adding support to \gls{HDFS} to delta-rs becomes a requirement of this project. Additionally, it should be noted that to meet development standards to the repository, the object\_store \cite{Object_storeRust} interface of the Datafusion \cite{ApacheDataFusionApache} should be used.
