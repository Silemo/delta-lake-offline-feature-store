In this section I will describe the boundary/limits of your thesis project and what you are explicitly not going to do. This will help you bound your efforts - as you have clearly defined what is out of the scope of this thesis project. Explain the delimitations. These are all the things that could affect the study if they were examined and included in the degree project.
