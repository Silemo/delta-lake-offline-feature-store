%In this section I will describe the boundaries/limits of your thesis project and what you are explicitly not going to do. This will help you bind your efforts - as you have clearly defined what is out of the scope of this thesis project. Explain the delimitations. These are all the things that could affect the study if they were examined and included in the degree project.
The project is conducted in collaboration with Hopsworks \gls{AB}, and as such the implementation will focus on working with their system using \gls{HopsFS}. While the consideration drawn from these results cannot be generalized and be true for any system, they can still provide an insight into Spark limitations, and on which tools perform better in different data scales.
