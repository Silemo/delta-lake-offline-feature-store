%This section will describe how the thesis is structured indicating various chapters.
Chapter \ref{ch:background} equips readers with the necessary foundational knowledge to navigate the layered data stack that this research operates with. Furthermore, it also introduces the legacy and new system architectures that will be employed during the experiments. Chapter \ref{ch:method} defines the methodology for the two key components of this iterative thesis work, i.e. the system implementation and system evaluation. Chapter \ref{ch:implementation} details the design choices taken during the system development and describes how to deploy use and the system.  
Chapter \ref{ch:results_and_analysis} presents the results of the experiments carried out, outlining the differences between the defined pipelines, and the different \gls{CPU} configurations. The chapter is also complemented with a discussion section that enables the reader to appreciate this thesis findings and implications. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:conclusions_and_future_work} summarizes the thesis contribution and findings, while also providing a discussion on the limitations and future work.
