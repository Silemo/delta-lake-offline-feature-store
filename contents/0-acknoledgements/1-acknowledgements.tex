The work that brought me to complete this master's thesis made me grow incredibly, laying a foundation of the person I am today. This would not have been possible without many individuals, whom I would like to thank in this section.

I would like to thank Jim Dowling for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and Salman Niazi for helping me make it happen. Many thanks also to all the Hopsworks AB employees who welcomed me from day one.

I would like to thank my KTH examiner, Vladimir Vlassov, and my two supervisors, Fabian Schmidt and Sina Sheikholeslami, for their many corrections to my numerous drafts.

I would like to thank all my friends who made me feel part of a larger family in the last years. Especially my Milan group, to which I will never be tired of returning: Sebastiano, Virginia, Luca, Alfonso, Giacomo, and Andrea. A special mention goes to Sebastiano, who, in the last year, was always by my side, a fantastic partner in an ever-changing world. Even if we have parted ways for now, I would still love to visit you in any city you might be in.

I would like to thank my parents and my brothers. In my most challenging moments, they helped me get back on track to complete this project while supporting me all the way. You enabled me to perform my best now and in the future.

Finally, I would like to thank my loved one, Elena, who was by my side well before I started my academic path. You were my space of serenity, even in the darkest hour. You brought me joy when I felt I couldn't feel any. I look forward to our present and our future together.
