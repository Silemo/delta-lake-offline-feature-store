The limitations of this study mostly derive from the constraints of resources, in terms of time and computational resources, and scope, which is mainly linked to the defined use case (Section \ref{subsec:use_case}). 

This project's scope is to improve the latency of the Hopsworks Offline Feature Store, and this is the technology on which the implementation and the experiments were based. This outlines the limited generalization of the results obtained, which are biased from the use of technology in collaboration with the company developing it. Additionally, a specific use case was defined (Section \ref{subsec:use_case}) to choose the \gls{CPU} loads and data loads on which the experiments would be conducted. This helps to define a perimeter of the thesis contribution but also limits the thesis impact on this specific use case, requiring more research to verify the same hypothesis in a different scenario.

While great in size, the computational resources provided were used on a shared environment that could only be used for a limited amount of time and only if it was not operating other, more critical workloads. Time also played a role in limiting the number of experiments to be conducted to calculate a 95\% confidence interval. All experiments were run 50 times, which increases by a significant factor the time required to perform all experiments.
