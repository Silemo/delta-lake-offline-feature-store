When talking about Spark origins and reasons behind its creation we need to look into Google needs for advancing in the internet search and indexing. In particular these needs led to the creation of MapReduce \cite{deanMapReduceSimplifiedData2008}, a distributed programming model that enables the management of large datasets. This paradigm became then part of the Hadoop ecosystem \cite{ApacheHadoop}. 
From the roots of MapReduce, Spark was created \cite{zahariaApacheSparkUnified2016}, improving both on the performance (10 times better in its first iteration), and on the fault tolerance, using \glspl{RDD}. \glspl{RDD} is a distributed memory abstraction that enables a lazy in-memory computation that is tracked though the use of lineage graphs, ultimately increasing fault tolerance \cite{Zaharia:EECS-2011-82}.
